# 🎉 STEM Pay – A Transparent USDT-Based Lottery on Polygon

STEM Pay is a decentralized, on-chain lottery system powered by USDT and our native token, **STEM**. Built on the Polygon blockchain, our platform ensures a fair and transparent experience for every participant.

## 🎰 How the Lottery System Works

- Users buy **STEM** tokens using **USDT** (Tether) on Polygon.
- STEM tokens are used to participate in regular lottery draws.
- Each ticket costs a fixed amount of STEM.
- Winners are selected via verifiable randomness (on-chain or Chainlink VRF in future versions).
- Winnings are distributed in **USDT**, and excess profit flows into a designated profit treasury.

All logic is handled by smart contracts, with zero manual interference — ensuring full transparency.
